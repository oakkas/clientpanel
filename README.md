This project is a client panel where you can add your clients, client details and balance.

Only a registered user can navigate to the dashboard, add-client and edit-cleint-details pages.

Registered user may disable/enable Allow Registration. If rehistration is disabled, no link to registration page can be found.

I used React, Redux, Firebase, Firestore, Bootstrap for the application.

The app is live @: https://reactclientpanel-47b9a.firebaseapp.com/login?redirect=%2F
